=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a base class that should be inherited and not used directly.
When logging in to the Pandora API, you must first login using a particular
partner, such as an Apple iOS or Android device.  Each partner has its own
credentials and encryption/decryption keys, and some use different HTTP hosts
than others to query the API.  The B<WebService::Pandora> package provides
modules for several known partners and will default to using
B<WebService::Pandora::Partner::iOS> if one isn't provided.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR
