=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WebService::Pandora::Method> is a module which queries the Pandora JSON API using the
B<LWP::UserAgent> and B<HTTP::Request> libraries.  It is used by the main B<WebService::Pandora>
module for all of the webservice methods it exposes.  It handles all of the encryption,
decryption, JSON conversion, and the Pandora API oddities for you.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

Creates a new B<WebService::Pandora::Method> object with the arguments given.  The method can
then be B<execute()>ed, returning a decrypted hashref representation of the JSON string returned
by the Pandora API method.

  $method = WebService::Pandora::Method->new( name => 'methodName',
                                              partnerAuthToken => 'token',
                                              userAuthToken => 'token',
                                              partnerId => 'id',
                                              userId => 'id',
                                              syncTime => 1356998400,
                                              host => 'tuner.pandora.com',
                                              ssl => 1,
                                              encrypt => 1,
                                              cryptor => WebService::Pandora::Cryptor::iOS->new(),
                                              timeout => 10,
                                              params => {'param1' => 'val1',
                                                         'param2' => 'val2'} );

=item name =E<gt> STRING [required]

The name of the Pandora API method to call.

=item partnerAuthToken STRING [optional]

The partner authentication token to use.  This is returned by the B<auth.partnerLogin> API method
and needed for some of the subsequent method calls.

=item userAuthToken STRING [optional]

The user authentication token to use.  This is returned by the B<auth.userLogin> API method and
needed for some of the subsequent method calls.

=item partnerId STRING [optional]

The partner id to use.  This is returned by the B<auth.partnerLogin> API method and needed for
some of the subsequent method calls.

=item userId STRING [optional]

The user id to use.  This is returned by the B<auth.userLogin> API method and needed for some of
the subsequent method calls.

=item syncTime INTEGER [optional]

The unix epoch timestamp from when we logged in to the Pandora API.  This is returned by the
B<auth.partnerLogin> API method and needed for some of the subsequent method calls.

=item host STRING [required]

The host portion of the URL where the Pandora JSON API is located.  This is typically either
B<tuner.pandora.com> or B<internal-tuner.pandora.com>.

=item ssl BOOLEAN [optional]

Whether or not to use HTTP or HTTPS when executing the method.  Defaults to false (HTTP).  Some
of the Pandora API methods require HTTP, and others require HTTPS, so its important to specify
the correct option depending upon which method.

=item encrypt BOOLEAN [optional]

Whether or not to encrypt the JSON data being sent using the B<WebService::Pandora::Cryptor>
object given via the B<cryptor> argument.  Defaults to true, as most Pandora API methods require
it.

=item cryptor B<WebService::Pandora::Cryptor> [optional]

The cryptor object to use to encrypt the JSON data when the B<encrypt> option is given a true
value.

=item timeout INTEGER [optional]

The timeout, in seconds, to pass to the underlying B<LWP::UserAgent> object when the method is
B<execute()>ed.  Defaults to 10.

=item params HASHREF [optional]

Any additional name => value pairs of parameters to pass to the method being executed.  Many of
the Pandora API methods require parameters to be given, so its important to specify the correct
ones.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 execute

Returns either a JSON-decrypted hashref of the result from the Pandora API method call, or a
true or false value to indicate success or failure.  Use the B<error()> method to find out why
the method call failed.  Internally, it will use B<LWP::UserAgent> to send a crafted
B<HTTP::Request> based upon all the arguments provided to the constructor.

=head2 error

Returns a string containing a message about why the method call failed.  The error string may
come from internally in the module, from a failed HTTP request, or from the Pandora API itself.
